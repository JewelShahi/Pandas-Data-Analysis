# 🐼 Pandas Projects & Practice

Welcome to my collection of hands-on projects, exercises, and tutorials using **Pandas**, the powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

This repository is a personal learning hub where I explore real-world datasets, practice essential data wrangling techniques, and build confidence working with tabular data using Pandas.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on real-world datasets  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** techniques  
- 🧪 **Mini Projects** to apply Pandas to actual problems  
- 💡 **Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts** for efficient Pandas usage  
- 📁 Well-documented **Jupyter/Colab Notebooks**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` (mostly this Python Framework)
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (for visualization)
- `Google Colab` (for running notebooks in the cloud)

---

## 📚 Why This Repo?

I created this repository to:
- Reinforce my understanding of Pandas
- Build a portfolio of data projects
- Help others who are learning data analysis with Python

---

## 💡 How to Use

You can view the notebooks directly on GitHub or run them in Google Colab:

1. Open and read the file (it has outputs too)
2. Download and run locally using Jupyter / Google Colab or your favorite code editor

## 📌 Sample Dataset Sources

Most of the datasets were downloaded from [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and uploaded to Google Drive (for convenience)

---

## 🧠 In Progress

I'm continuously expanding this repository as I explore more data and use cases with Pandas.

Just being curios what Python can... 😀
